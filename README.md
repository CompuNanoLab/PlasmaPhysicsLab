# Laboratory of Plasma Physics
This repository contains the material for the lectures on computational plasma physics of the *Laboratory of Plasma Physics* course.

- [Computational Plasma Physics and Orbit Theory](./Lecture1) (29th February 2024)
- [Particle-in-cell Simulations for Laser-plasma Interaction](./Lecture2) (5th May 2024)

These lectures are provided in flipped class mode.

Please complete the following steps before the lectures (new steps are in **bold**):
1. Download this repository. Click on **<> Code** on the top right of this page.
