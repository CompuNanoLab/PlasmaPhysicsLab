# Lecture on Computational Plasma Physics and Orbit Theory
This folder contains the material for the lecture of the Laboratory of Plasma Physics course scheduled on 29th February 2024. This lecture is provided in flipped class mode. The material for the lecture comprises two documents to read and three exercises in Python on Jupyter Notebooks.

Please complete the following steps before the lecture:
1. Download this repository. Click on **<> Code** on the top right of this page.
2. Install Python and Jupyter on your PC. Some useful links:
   - If you don't know what is a Jupyter Notebook: [Beginner guide to Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
   - Basic Python installation guide: [Link to python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
   - Jupyter installation guide: [Link to Jupyter installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install).
   - Visual Studio Code + Python installation guide: [Link to VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#__install-a-python-interpreter).
   - Installing Jupyter using Anaconda: [Link to Installing the classic Jupyter Notebook interface](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html).
4. Read the material in this repository (you can do it by simply clicking on the links below).
5. Try to work on the exercises in your downloaded version of this repository with your Python compiler and the code editor of your choice.
   
   Alternative if you don't want to install anything: use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or fork this repository (button on the top right) and use [Github developer option](https://github.dev/github/dev) to work on your forked version of this repository.
 
 Here is a list of the material:
* [Introduction to Computational Plasma Physics](./Intro_Comp_Plasma_Phys.md)
* [Orbit Theory](./Orbit_Theory.md)
* Exercises on Orbit Theory:
    - [Exercise 1](./Exercise1.ipynb)
    - [Exercise 2](./Exercise2.ipynb)
    - [Exercise 3](./Exercise3.ipynb)

Notes: 
* The markdown files (.md) in this repository generate the text you are seeing. You don't need to do any action on them.
* The python files (.py) support the working of the Jupyter notebook of [Exercise 1](./Exercise1.ipynb). You need them in the same folder of Exercise1.ipynb. No action on them is required on your side.
