# Lecture on Computational Plasma Physics and Orbit Theory
This folder contains the material for the lecture of the Laboratory of Plasma Physics course scheduled on 29th February 2024. This lecture is provided in flipped class mode. The material for the lecture comprises two documents to read and three exercises in Python on Jupyter Notebooks.

Please follow the following steps before this lecture:
1. Read the material in this repository (you can do it by simply clicking on the links below).
2. Try to work on the exercises in your downloaded version of this repository with your Python compiler and the code editor of your choice.

 Here is a list of the material:
* [Introduction to Computational Plasma Physics](./Intro_Comp_Plasma_Phys.md)
* [Orbit Theory](./Orbit_Theory.md)
* Exercises on Orbit Theory:
    - [Exercise 1](./Exercise1.ipynb)
    - [Exercise 2](./Exercise2.ipynb)
    - [Exercise 3](./Exercise3.ipynb)

Notes: 
* The markdown files (.md) in this repository generate the text you are seeing. You don't need to do any action on them.
* The python files (.py) support the working of the Jupyter notebook of [Exercise 1](./Exercise1.ipynb). You need them in the same folder of Exercise1.ipynb. No action on them is required on your side.
