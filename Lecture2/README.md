# Lecture on Particle-in-cell simulations for Laser-plasma Interaction
This folder contains the material for the lecture of the Laboratory of Plasma Physics course scheduled on 2nd May 2024. The material for the lecture comprises one document with explanations of the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method, a 1D PIC code in Python on a Jupyter Notebook, and instructions to perform and analyze a simulation with the PIC code [Smilei](https://smileipic.github.io/Smilei/).

 Here is a list of the material:
* [PIC Basics](./PIC_basics.md)
* [1D PIC code](./1DPIC.ipynb)
* [Instructions for a Smilei simulation](./PIC_smilei.md)
