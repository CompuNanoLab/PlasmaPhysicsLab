# Assignment

You can submit an assignment on your computational activity. It is not mandatory and you don't have a deadline (submit when you have something ready).

Try to do the following steps:

- Select a tool among the 1D Python code on the Jupyter Notebook, the Smilei 1D code or the Smilei 2D code.
- Investigate three conditions of plasma density:
  - $n_e = 10^{-2}  n_c$
  - $n_e = 1  n_c$
  - $n_e = 100  n_c$
- Show some plots of these three scenarios and tell if you can identify the  typical  properties of laser interaction in the underdense, critical, and overdense regimes.
- Identify possible numerical problems in the simulations (low spatial resolution, low number of particles per cell, box too small, ...) and possible effects that you are seeing
(numerical heating of the plasma, anomalous behaviour at the boundaries, ...).
- Propose and possibly try solutions to the numerical problems.  Report any computational limits encountered (the simulation is very slow, the RAM is not enough, the simulation crashed
unexpectedly, etc..)
- If you have time to explore more, try to change some other parameters like:
  - $a_0$ (< 1, ~1, ~10s)
  - Kind of plasma ions
  - Laser focal spot
  - Laser duration
  - Plasma shape
- Comment on your results
